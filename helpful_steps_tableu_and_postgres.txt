Setting up Tableu:

1. Simply download tableu for mac and sign in with any id for a 14 day trial.
2. If you want you can login using your student account and get a trial for a longer duration.
3. Once your tableu starts working you can start by loading an excel file to see how the data loading, refreshing and all looks and then you can connect it with a db later.
4. There are a lot of things you can do in tableu. I highly recommend going through their documentation if you are planning to use filters and all.
5. To summarize the working -  Once your data is loaded, you can drag/drop columns and measures from the left onto sheets, combine sheets to form dashboards and if you want, combine dashboards into stories.

Setting up postgresql:

1. Postgresql is free relational db available for all platforms
2. brew install postgresql 
3. This should install postgresql in your system. However, you may face a port issue (since it by default runs on 5432)
4. For me, i just stopped the service and restarted again and it worked...
5. brew services stop postgresql
6. brew services restart postgresql
7. Simply use by typing: psql postgres on your terminal
8. You may want to create roles and set up username and password tho its not mandatory. I setup a username and password for myself which I used in tableu to postgres integration

Integration:
1. Integration of postgresql to tableu is pretty strightforward
2. You can add a new data source "postgresql". In server put "localhost" port- 5432, database-"postgres" and username and password
3. If you face error in postgres connection to Tableau, copy the jar to ~/Library/Tableau/Drivers (create folder if needed)
jar file -> postgresql-42.2.22.jar or postgresql-42.3.1.jar (based on version). The jar can be found in tableau_driver/ folder in the project
4. Restart Tableau, postgres server if needed.

Hope this helps
