## What does this repository contain?

This repository contains the code of CMPT-732 (Big Data I) for the group "Knights"

## Developer notes:
1. Make sure to checkout your own branch and push code commits there with semantic versioning.
2. Avoid pushing anything in main except updating README (if necessary)
3. Make sure to take a pull everytime you are doing some changes to ensure consistency

## Types of attacks:
1. DoS is an attack that tries to shut down traffic flow to and from the target system. The IDS is flooded with an abnormal amount of traffic, which the system can’t handle, and shuts down to protect itself. This prevents normal traffic from visiting a network. An example of this could be an online retailer getting flooded with online orders on a day with a big sale, and because the network can’t handle all the requests, it will shut down preventing paying customers to purchase anything. This is the most common attack in the data set.
2. Probe or surveillance is an attack that tries to get information from a network. The goal here is to act like a thief and steal important information, whether it be personal information about clients or banking information.
3. U2R is an attack that starts off with a normal user account and tries to gain access to the system or network, as a super-user (root). The attacker attempts to exploit the vulnerabilities in a system to gain root privileges/access.
4. R2L is an attack that tries to gain local access to a remote machine. An attacker does not have local access to the system/network, and tries to “hack” their way into the network.
5. An access attack is just what it sounds like: an attempt to access another user account or network device through improper means. If proper security measures are not in place, the network may be left vulnerable to intrusion. A network administrator is responsible for ensuring that only authorized users access the network. Unauthorized attacks are attempted via four means, all of which try to bypass some facet of the authentication process: password attacks, trust exploitation, port redirection, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
6. More dangerous is vertical privilege escalation (also called privilege elevation), where the attacker gains the rights of a more privileged account – typically the administrator or system user on Microsoft Windows or root on Unix and Linux systems. With this elevated level of access, the attacker can wreak all sorts of havoc in your computer systems and applications: steal access credentials and sensitive data, download and execute ransomware, erase data, or execute arbitrary code. Advanced attackers will use elevated privileges to cover their tracks by deleting access logs and other evidence of their activity, leaving the victim unaware that an attack took place at all. That way, cybercriminals can covertly steal information and plant backdoors or other malware in company systems.
